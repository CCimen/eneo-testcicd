# Security Policy

Eneo takes security seriously as a platform designed for public sector organizations handling sensitive data. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guidelines.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Philosophy

**Security by Design**: Eneo implements security controls at every layer, from the database to the user interface.

**Compliance First**: Built with GDPR and EU AI Act compliance requirements in mind.

**Transparency**: Open source security allows for community review and verification.

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls protect against various threat vectors.

---

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

**Multi-layer Authentication**:
- JWT-based session management with secure token handling
- Bcrypt password hashing with configurable complexity
- API key authentication for service integrations
- Optional OIDC/SSO integration for enterprise environments

**Granular Authorization**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- Multi-tenant data isolation with row-level security
- Space-based access controls for collaborative features
- API endpoint authorization checks

**Security Headers**:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### Data Protection

**Encryption**:
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data fields
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
- **Database**: PostgreSQL transparent data encryption support
- **Secrets**: Environment-based secret management

**Data Handling**:
- PII detection and masking in logs
- Secure file upload validation and processing
- Automatic data retention policy enforcement
- Audit trails for all data access and modifications

### Infrastructure Security

**Container Security**:
- Non-root container execution where possible
- Minimal base images with regular security updates
- Secret management through environment variables
- Network isolation between services

**Network Security**:
- Default deny firewall rules
- Service-to-service communication over internal networks
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Automated SSL certificate management

## üîê Security Guidelines for Developers

### Secure Coding Practices

**Input Validation**:
```python
# Always validate and sanitize input
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator

class CreateAssistantRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100, regex=r'^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_]+$')
    description: str = Field(..., max_length=500)
    
    @validator('name')
    def validate_name(cls, v):
        # Additional validation logic
        if not v.strip():
            raise ValueError('Name cannot be empty')
        return v.strip()
```

**SQL Injection Prevention**:
```python
# Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries
from sqlalchemy import text

# Good - parameterized query
result = session.execute(
    text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email"),
    {"email": user_email}
)

# Bad - string concatenation
# result = session.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{user_email}'")
```

**XSS Prevention**:
```typescript
// Frontend - always escape user content
import { escape } from 'html-escaper';

function displayUserContent(content: string): string {
    return escape(content);
}

// Svelte - use {@html} carefully
<!-- Good -->
<p>{userContent}</p>

<!-- Be careful with this -->
<!-- {@html sanitizedContent} -->
```

**Authentication Checks**:
```python
# Always verify authentication and authorization
@router.get("/assistants/{assistant_id}")
async def get_assistant(
    assistant_id: UUID,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),  # Required auth
    service: AssistantService = Depends()
) -> AssistantResponse:
    # Verify user has access to this specific assistant
    assistant = await service.get_assistant_with_permission_check(
        assistant_id, 
        current_user
    )
    return AssistantResponse.from_domain(assistant)
```
