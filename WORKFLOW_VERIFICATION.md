# Complete CI/CD Workflow Verification

## Test Scenario: Feature → Develop → Main

### Step 1: Feature Branch Creation ✅
- **Branch**: `feature/complete-cicd-verification`
- **Date**: $(date)
- **Purpose**: End-to-end CI/CD verification

### Expected Workflow:

1. **Feature Branch** → No builds (correct)
2. **Merge to Develop** → Builds: `develop`, `develop-{sha}`
3. **Merge to Main** → Builds: `latest`, `v{version}`, `main-{sha}`

### Changes Made:
- Added this verification document
- Test that semantic versioning works correctly
- Verify all branch naming conventions

### Next Steps:
1. Push feature branch to GitHub (visible in repo)
2. Merge to develop → trigger develop build
3. Merge to main → trigger production build with version increment

### Expected Results:
- **Develop tags**: `develop`, `develop-{sha}`
- **Main tags**: `latest`, `v0.0.2` (or next version), `main-{sha}`
- **Git tags**: New version tag created in repository
